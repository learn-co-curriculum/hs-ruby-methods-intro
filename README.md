**Methods** are the secret sauce to writing code in Ruby. A method is *a reusable chunk of code written to perform a specific task in a program*, like reverse a string or add 10 to a number. In this lesson you will learn:

* Where to find Ruby's **built-in methods in the Ruby documentation**
* How to **write your own** methods in Ruby
* How to **use interactive ruby (IRB)** to test out your code
